* Measure board marker statistics: fraction visible, brightness average, brightness std, rgb average
    * Persist? Not necessarily in this partial state
* Solve for: board normal, per-light correction factor
    * Compare per-light corrections for each scene
    * Apply rotations, store correction
* Save index with corrections applied
